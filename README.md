This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have nodeJS installed, this is vital in running the application.

You can check if you have nodeJS installed by running the command,

```
node -v
```

Secondly, once you have NodeJS installed, clone the repository, then install the necessary dependencies by running the command inside your repository,

```
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server, the terminal will provide you with a locahost:PORT_NUMBER link to access the website:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Testing

Testing (i.e. Unit, Integration, E2E) will be done with GitHub Actions and Jest will be done automatically, this will be covered in detail over the upcoming months. The important thing to know is that all the code on the MAIN branch should always work, and should be tested thorougly when the codebase gets larger.
